contiki-temperature-flash
=========================

Contiki application that takes measurements from Temperature, Humidity, Visible
and IR Light on TelosB (Tmote Sky) motes and saves to flash memory.

The data is stored in CoffeeFS in the onboard flash and dumped out when the mote
boots.  When the user button on the mote is pressed, the storage is formatted
and the mote rebooted.
